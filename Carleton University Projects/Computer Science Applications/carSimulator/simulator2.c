    Test case results that are hard-coded in main
Description:
    simulates a simple parking lot
    keeps track of weather or not a car is in a lot at a given moment
    keeps track of how much time passes between a car entering and leaving a lot
    determines how much money the lot makes, based on how long cars are in the lot and the lots
        hourly rate
    keeps track of how many cars are in the lot, weather the lots full, and if a car has a permit to
        allow it to not pay a toll
    outputs the results of the hard-coded test cases in main to the shell
