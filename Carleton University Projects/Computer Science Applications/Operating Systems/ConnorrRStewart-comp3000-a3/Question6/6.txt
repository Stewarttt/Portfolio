[2] Would it have been harder to make /dev/yourtask report usernames rather than uids? Explain, outlining at least one strategy for outputting usernames rather than uid's:
	Yes, it would be harder to make /dev/yourtask report usernames rather than uids.
		As we have learned, the unix kernal passes "necessary" information in its task_structs to lower overhead
		The task_struct is not going to have both a uid and username in it, as it would then contain redundant information
		since the uid is going to be shorter then the username in most cases, only user id's are stored in the task struct.
	Strategies:
		1. Usernames and user IDs stored within "/etc/passwd", so we could always open the file, iterate through it looking for the UID, and find its corresponding username
		2. We could setup some functions to enable running BASH scripts from within the c code, and run "id -un -UID"
			according to "man id", id prints real and effective user and group IDs
			also within its man page we see that -un can be used to get the real name of the user
			thus, if we wanted to find the username of UID 1000, we could run "ls -un 1000" within the c code
		3. If the C program bas BASH scripts enabled within it, a wrapper for the following BASH script "getent passwd -UID | cut -d: -f1" would work
			if someone wanted to find the username associated with UID 1000, they could enter "getent passwd 1000 | cut -d: -f1"
