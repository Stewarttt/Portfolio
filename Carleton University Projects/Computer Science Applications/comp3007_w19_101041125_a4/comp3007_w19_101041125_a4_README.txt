Question 3:
	Open SWI-Prolog and open comp3007_w19_101041125_a4_3.pl
	Type:
		entryPoint(1, 15)
			This will check all possible ways to cross the river in 1 to 15 crossings
			This function can take a lot of time to buffer new intervals
				for example, when it transitions between all passages of size 9 
				to all passages of size 11 it pauses for a bit. Waiting will 
				resolve this.
	Returns:
		All possible paths (there are a lot of them)
		Returns true if a valid search is conducted
			a valid search means that the start and end ranges (in entryPoint) are logical, that is, the start value is less then or equal to the end value
			this means, even if a search returns no possible paths, the method will return true, indicating that the search was at least successful in 
				finding that no path existed.
			
	My tuple representation represents the number of people in the boat at a given crossing
		we assume the boat starts at the west side and moves to the east side
		the boat always moves from west to east, or from east to west during each crossing
		the tuple represents the number of entities crossing in the following format:
			(Neanderthal, Human, Saber-tooth Tiger)
			the number represents the number of the entities crossing, for example:
				(1, 0, 0) means 1 Neanderthal is crossing the river
		Take the following example: [(1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0)] this means a Neanderthal crosses to the west side. After that, it crosses back to the right side.
